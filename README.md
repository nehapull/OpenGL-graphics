Projects in OpenGL 

The following is a brief description of each project done:

Project 2: Implmented 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) and projected the resulting transformations as 
           axonometric orthographic projections. The screenshots in the folder show the projected polyhedras as well as
           an output for 3D rotation of a cube with a rotation axis.
           
Project 3: Implemented the Phong Shading Model to find the intensities of each vertex of three 3D polyhedral objects using a 
           triangular mesh. The intensities from Phong were then used to implement 3D Gouraud shading using linear
           interpolation. The polygons were redrawn and mapped to pixel coordinates. The program also allows the user to 
           choose between turning on and off half-toning. Half-toning was implemented by simulating ten intensity levels using
           3X3 virtual pixels.
           
Project 4: Implemented Bezier and B-spline curves from scratch, where the user can enter the desired control points and knot
           values for b-spline curves.
